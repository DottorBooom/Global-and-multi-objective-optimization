# Global and multi objective optimization

## Index 

+ [Genetic algorithms](#genetic-algorithms)

## Introduction

+ It will be entirely in English, slides made by the professor on which I will take notes lesson after lesson.
+ Some books have also been recommended if you want to follow from there or go deeper, I will try to upload those as well.
+ The final exam will consist of a project assigned by the professor and anb oral presentation for exposing it. The professor will ask about project's topic

### What you will learn

+ **Genetic alforithms**
+ **Evolution strategies**
+ **Genetic programming**
+ **Particle swarm optimization and anti-colony optimization**
+ **Differential evolution**
+ **Neuroevolutioin**
+ **EDA and CMA-ES**
+ **Parallel implementations**
+ **Multi-objective optimization**
+ **Coevolution**
+ **Policy optimization**
+ **Theory of evolutionary computation**

### Common rules & principles

+ Every question is **legitimate and useful**, ask what you do not understand
+ Main pourpose it to **learn**, not to grade
+ Learning is a **process**, not a result
+ Nobody is perfect or always right: **errors and mistake are natural**
+ **Learning is a process in our personal brain**, not in other's one. **Clash with your limits** before check the solution

## Genetic algorithms

Information about the course and what to expect, including recommended books. 
Examples of what this course will cover

+ Genetic algorithms, story, functioning, evolution cycle (generation, parameters, selection, crossovers and mutation)
+ Variants of the algorithm
