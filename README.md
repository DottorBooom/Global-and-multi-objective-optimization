## Introduction

+ It will be entirely in English, slides made by the professor on which I will take notes lesson after lesson.
+ Some books have also been recommended if you want to follow from there or go deeper, I will try to upload those as well.
+ The final exam will consist of a project assigned by the professor and an oral presentation for exposing it. The professor will ask about project's topic too.

### What you will learn

+ **Genetic alforithms**
+ **Evolution strategies**
+ **Genetic programming**
+ **Particle swarm optimization and anti-colony optimization**
+ **Differential evolution**
+ **Neuroevolutioin**
+ **EDA and CMA-ES**
+ **Parallel implementations**
+ **Multi-objective optimization**
+ **Coevolution**
+ **Policy optimization**
+ **Theory of evolutionary computation**

### Common rules & principles

+ Every question is **legitimate and useful**, ask what you do not understand
+ Main pourpose it to **learn**, not to grade
+ Learning is a **process**, not a result
+ Nobody is perfect or always right: **errors and mistake are natural**
+ **Learning is a process in our personal brain**, not in other's one. **Clash with your limits** before check the solution

## Genetic algorithms

Information about the course and what to expect, including recommended books. 
Examples of what this course will cover

+ Genetic algorithms: story, functioning, evolution cycle (generation, parameters, selection, crossovers and mutation), variants of GA and speial rapresentations.
+ First notebook of the course that introduce an GA algorithm with a binary string and compare the result with other algorithms (random, hill climbing and simulated annealing). It shows how does it work, how to write a propper fit and some particular case.

Slides are available [here](Lectures/1_Genetic_algorithms.pdf)
Notebook is available [here](Lectures/1_Genetic_algorithms_Ex.ipynb)

## Evolution strategies

+ Evolution strategies: the ideas, parameters and cycle, mutation and recombinations
+ Notebook that contain an implementation of an evolution strategies that try to find the optimum inside different 3Ds functions.

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_2/)

## Intro to genetic programming

+ Genetic programmin: outlines, the evolution cycle, the rappresentations and sufficiency rule. The initialisation methods, crossover methods and mutation methods. Automatically defined functions nad what is bloat and how to solve it.
+  Notebook that contain that show how to use an implmentation of a simbolic regression using the library gp learn. it is shown how does it work and the results.

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_3/)
